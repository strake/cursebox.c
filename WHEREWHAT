In this file I summarize things in cursebox.

Many files are yet named as "termbox", the name of the library this was forked from.

SOURCES
-------

termbox.c / termbox.h - main files of termbox library, you generally only
need to include termbox.h in your projects.

ringbuffer.c / ringbuffer.h - simple ring buffer, I use it for buffering
input. Because terminals theoretically can work via network (which is
slow and unpredictable), this feature is a 'must have'.

term.c / term.h - terminal specific database. It resembles terminfo 
database, but only for fairly popular terminals.

input.c - this is the input parsing code.

utf8.c - simple utf8 <-> unicode converting code.

SCRIPTS
-------

collectkeys.py - this script collects keys and other terminfo capabilities
from terminfo database, it generates code which then is being inserted
in term.c.

DEMOS
-----

keyboard.c - This is a demo of keyboard. It draws nice ASCII-art keyboard
using termbox library ofcourse and reacts on user input by highlighting
pressed keys and combos. Just try it, it's really nice.
